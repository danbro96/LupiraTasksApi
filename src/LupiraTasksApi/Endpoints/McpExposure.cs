/// Defence-in-depth backstop keeping the prefixes below LAN/WireGuard-only. The PRIMARY control is the
/// Cloudflare Tunnel ingress not routing them to the container (host config, outside this repo). This
/// middleware survives an ingress mistake: anything through the Cloudflare edge carries <c>CF-Ray</c>/
/// <c>CF-Connecting-IP</c>, which a direct LAN/WireGuard request never does — so a tunnelled hit is
/// answered 404, indistinguishable from "no such route". Plain middleware rather than an endpoint filter
/// because <c>MapMcp</c>'s streaming endpoint does not run the minimal-API filter pipeline.
